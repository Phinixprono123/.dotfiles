# Regex engine is similar to RE2: https://github.com/rust-lang/regex
#
# Use `swaymsg -t get_outputs` to get a list of outputs in the format:
# Output ${NAME} '${DESCRIPTION}'
# Use `swaymsg -t get_outputs` or `hyprctl monitors` to list your outputs.
# The description of the output is what is matched.
# This often contains the output name, manufacturer, model, and serial number so
# any of those could be used for matching.
